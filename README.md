Sketch Recognition & Artist Feedback System

This project recognizes hand-drawn sketches or portraits by matching them with a Bollywood celebrity face dataset using deep face embeddings. It predicts the closest match with a confidence score and provides feature-level feedback for artists by comparing facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, and jaw.
